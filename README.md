## Project Summary
MyWonder is a platform for big data analytics and visualization that allows users to calculate their analytics from their phones and create visualizations from massive files within 10 minutes. Previously, users had to wait for hours to complete the process of visualizations.

The method approached by MyWonder is to distribute the files on the cloud to increase speed and save more time. Users can calculate summaries from their phones directly which is useful for meetings.

MyWonder is conducted by Khider&Garijo CORP.
