## Project Summary
MyWonder is a platform for big data analytics and visualization that allows users to calculate their analytics from their phones and create visualizations from massive files within 10 minutes. Previously, users had to wait for hours to complete the process of visualizations. 

The method approached by MyWonder is to distribute the files on the cloud to increase speed and save more time. Users can calculate summaries from their phones directly which is useful for meetings. 

MyWonder is conducted by Khider&Garijo CORP.

## Wastes
1. **Waiting:** The terminology and contents in the user interface is not understandable and intuitive so that it takes time from meetings with clients to ask help from customer assistance team. 

2. **Transport:** Since only the backend team can update the content, customer support had to talk to the designers about the problems and then the designers communicated with the backend team. The process of solving problems is too complicated. 

3. **Skills:** There is not a separate testing and production environment to allow to change contents quickly before a demo.
