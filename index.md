## Project Summary
MyWonder is a platform for big data analytics and visualization that allows users to calculate their analytics from their phones and create visualizations from massive files within 10 minutes. Previously, users had to wait for hours to complete the process of visualizations. 

The method approached by MyWonder is to distribute the files on the cloud to increase speed and save more time. Users can calculate summaries from their phones directly which is useful for meetings. 

MyWonder is conducted by Khider&Garijo CORP.

## Wastes
**1. Waiting:** The terminology and contents in the user interface are not understandable and intuitive so that it takes time from meetings with clients to ask for help from the customer assistance team. 

**2. Transport:** Since only the backend team can update the content, customer support had to talk to the designers about the problems, and then the designers communicated with the backend team. The process of solving problems is too complicated. 

**3. Skills:** There is not a separate testing and production environment to allow the CEO to change contents quickly before a demo.  

## Deliverables
1. Add a "Note" section in visualizations
2. Test new functionalities before releasing
3. Change the terminology and contents in the UI
4. Set up a separate testing and production environment
5. Create visualization examples in MyWonder for demos
6. Create a PowerPoint with screenshots to walk through a visualization

## Milestone
* **Content Update and Technical Preparation for demos:** Client Demos are important for the team. To have a good demo for different users, the contents used in the user interface should be understandable and changeable accordingly. Also, it needs some visualization examples to support. This milestone is focused on addressing these considerations and the technical preparation for demos, including updating the content on UI, setting up a separating testing and production environment, and creating visualization examples.
